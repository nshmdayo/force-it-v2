# ForceIt

This application proposes a concept of Body-based Interaction Methods and Systems for
Ambient Space.

## Original Java Implementation

The original implementation uses JavaFX and Kinect for motion tracking and particle interaction.

## Rust Implementation

This repository now includes a Rust implementation that provides:

- **Modern Graphics**: Uses `wgpu` for cross-platform GPU rendering
- **Physics Simulation**: Custom particle physics system with gravity and inter-particle forces  
- **Input System**: Mouse-based interaction (replaces Kinect dependency)
- **Performance**: Native Rust performance for real-time particle simulation

### Building and Running

Prerequisites:
- Rust toolchain (install from https://rustup.rs/)

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run the application
cargo run --release
```

### Controls

- **Space**: Calibrate the system
- **Mouse**: Control the virtual right hand
- **Left Click**: Open hand to create force particles
- **Escape**: Exit application

### Architecture

The Rust implementation consists of several modules:

- `vector.rs`: 3D vector mathematics
- `particle.rs`: Individual particle physics and rendering
- `physics.rs`: Overall physics system managing wall and force particles
- `input.rs`: Input handling and body joint simulation
- `renderer.rs`: GPU rendering using wgpu
- `main.rs`: Application loop and event handling

### Features

- Real-time particle wall simulation
- Force particle generation from hand movements
- Collision detection and response
- Gravity and spring forces
- Modular particle interactions
- Cross-platform compatibility

The system creates a wall of particles that respond to force particles generated by hand movements, simulating the original ambient interaction concept in a modern Rust framework.
